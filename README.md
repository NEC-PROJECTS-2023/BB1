**Introduction

Adult income analysis involves exploring the relationship between various demographic and socio-economic factors and an individual's income level. The "Adult" dataset is used for adult income analysis can be found in the UCI Machine Learning Repository [6]. The dataset contains information on people's ages, education levels, marital status, occupations, races, genders, and other characteristics. The primary objective variable is to determine whether a person makes more than $50,000 or less than $50,000 annually.

The dataset can be used to investigate and examine the relationship between these variables and a person's income level. This can assist researchers, policymakers, and businesses in better understanding the factors that influence income levels and developing strategies to improve them.

The dataset, which is split into training and testing sets, contains around 48 000 cases. It has been pre-processed and sanitized to remove any incorrect or missing values. The data is accessible via download and on the website of the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

This dataset can be used to explore and analyze the relationship between these variables and individual income levels. It helps researchers, policy makers and businesses understand the factors that influence income levels and develop strategies to improve them.

In this project we are using label Encoder to convert the categorical attributes to integer attributes. The algorithms work more efficiently on the integer data than the categorical data. The target variable in the analysis is income attribute, and it has two classes ‘>50k’ and ‘<=50K’ represented as 0 and 1.

Some common operations that we perform in this dataset is handling missing values, predicting unknown values represented as ‘?’, removing irrelevant features.
